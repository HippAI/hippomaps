Hippomap contains a set of tools for mapping data to the folded and unfolded hippocampus as generated by HippUnfold and using the Hippunfold_toolbox. Here, we map:
- ex-vivo histology (various stains and contrasts)
- resting state fMRI connectivity (rsfMRI FC)
- structural MRI (morphometry and various modality intensities)
- intracranial EEG (iEEG) recodings

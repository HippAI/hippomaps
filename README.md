HippoMaps is a toolbox and repository for open source mapping and contextualization of hippocampal data, paralleling surface-based mapping of the neocortex. This is partnered with a repository of mapped data at https://osf.io/92p34/.

Tools for mapping data the folded and unfolded hippocampus are designed to work seamlessly with outputs generated by [HippUnfold](https://github.com/khanlab/hippunfold). In the [tutorials](https://github.com/jordandekraker/hippomaps/tree/master/tutorials), we provide examples for mapping:
- laminar ex-vivo histology at the microscale
- structural MRI at 3T and 7T
- resting state fMRI properties and connectivity 
- spatially scattered intracranial EEG (iEEG) recodings
- task-fMRI data mapping with (nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html)
- comparison between maps and dimensionality reduction

These tutorials provide clear examples of how the tools here can be used, but for shorter examples and usage notes, see also [demos](https://github.com/jordandekraker/hippomaps/tree/master/hippomaps/demos).
